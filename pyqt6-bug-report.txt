Subject: [BUG] PyQt6 6.10.x crashes on macOS in PyInstaller bundles (qdarwinpermissionplugin static init)

Hi,

I've discovered a crash in PyQt6 6.10.x on macOS when used with PyInstaller. The app crashes 
during static initialization before any Python code runs.

## Crash Stack Trace

Thread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread
0   CoreFoundation   __CFCheckCFInfoPACSignature + 4
1   CoreFoundation   CFBundleCopyBundleURL + 24
2   QtCore           QLibraryInfoPrivate::paths + 2252
3   QtCore           QLibraryInfoPrivate::path + 48
...
8   QtCore           QLoggingRegistry::instance() + 172
9   QtCore           QLoggingCategory::QLoggingCategory + 56
10  QtCore.abi3.so   _GLOBAL__sub_I_qdarwinpermissionplugin_location.mm + 308
11  dyld             invocation function for block in dyld4::Loader::findAndRunAllInitializers

## Root Cause

The darwin permission plugin has a static initializer that creates a QLoggingCategory. 
During initialization, Qt calls CFBundleCopyBundleURL(CFBundleGetMainBundle()) which 
crashes because the bundle context is not properly set up at static initialization time 
in PyInstaller bundles.

## Environment

- macOS 15.3 (Sequoia) - ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- Python 3.11
- PyInstaller 6.x
- PyQt6 6.10.2 (crashes)
- PyQt6 6.5.3 (works fine)

## Minimal Reproduction

1. pip install PyQt6==6.10.2 pyinstaller
2. Create test.py:
   
   from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow
   import sys
   app = QApplication(sys.argv)
   window = QMainWindow()
   window.show()
   sys.exit(app.exec())

3. pyinstaller --windowed test.py
4. open dist/test.app  # crashes with SIGSEGV

## Analysis

The crash originates from _GLOBAL__sub_I_qdarwinpermissionplugin_location.mm being 
linked into QtCore.abi3.so. Its static initializer runs before the app bundle is 
properly set up by PyInstaller, causing CFBundleCopyBundleURL to fail.

## Possible Fix

Could the darwin permission plugin initialization be deferred until QApplication 
creation, rather than at static init time? Or add a NULL check for the bundle.

## Workaround

Downgrade to PyQt6 6.5.3:
  pip install 'PyQt6==6.5.3' 'PyQt6-Qt6==6.5.3'

Best regards,
